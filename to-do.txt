To-do list for applying ABM to real cities

1. Get weights of household numbers from census based on city name

2. Calculate industrial distance



Things that have changed to accomodate clinton

1. The move functions are very different.
	I used numpy for a lot of lists and therefore had to change many of the
	supporting functions (e.g. industry_agents)

2. collect_demands
